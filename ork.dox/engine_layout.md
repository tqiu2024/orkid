# Orkid Library Topology
###### Orkid is divided into several shared libraries:
---
## ork.core
  - Reflection system
  - General OS utilities
  - File IO
  - Performance minded containers
  - Math 
    + Linear Algebra - Layered on GLM
    + Trigonemtry
    + General 3D (Planes, Lines, Rays, Spheres, etc..)
    + Geometric Algebra (3D only - Layered on Klein)
    + Audio/DSP
    + PID
  - Operations Queue (higher level concurrency, inspired by Apple's GCD)
  - Threading / low-level concurrency
  - DataBlocks / DataCache - cache output of processed data.
  - Asset managers with on the fly (and cached) conversion
  - Includes python bindings
    + easy to use type-codec for shuttling engine data to/from python
  - Notable dependencies (License):
    + Boost (Boost, permissive)
    + Python3 (PSF, permissive)
    + PyBind11 (Custom, permissive)


###### python3 module: orkengine.core

## ork.lev2

      - MIDI/OSC
      - TUIO


  - Lower level graphics 
    + DrawBuffers - MultiBuffered threaded renderer
      - easy to use tecnique for shuttling render data across the thread boundary
      - render and update are fully asynchronous with respect to one another
    + RenderQueue (with coarse depth and state sorting)
    + Rigid/Skinned models with variable partitioning support
      - Loads GLTF2/GLB
        + embedded textures
        + Metallic Rougness PBR
      - Loads DAE, OBJ and probably other assimp formats
      - Instancing Support via instance textures
    + Custom callback/lambda based renderables
    + Animation controllers with masking, blending, and procedural animation support.
    + Dataflow graph based particle systems
    + PTEX: dataflow graph based procedural texturing system
      - you can put a PTEX on a light projector! (if you can afford the gpu time)


  - Compositor (aka Framegraph)
    + Overridable compositing techniques
    + Included Node Based Technique
      - Render, Post and Output Nodes
      - Screen, RtGroup and OpenVR Output Nodes
      - Binary (2in,1out) Operator Post Node
      - PTEX dataflow graph Post Node

      - Clustered/Deferred PBR Rendering node
        + Metallic, Roughness workflow
        + IBL base lighting
        + PointLights, SpotLights (w/textured cookies)
        + Cpu Light Processor
        + NvidiaMeshShader Light Processor (WIP)
        + Mono/Stereo support
      - Forward PBR Rendering node
        + Generally same features/lighting model as the deferred PBR node

  - Lower level audio
    + Spatialized audio effect system
    + Audio stream playback controllers
    + Singularity - Software synthesizer modeled on pro audio synthesizers
      - Loads Kurzweil KRZ files
      - Loads Casio CZ101 sysex files
      - Loads Yamaha TX81Z sysex files
      - Loads Soundfont SF2 files


  - Higher level Scenegraph.
    + SceneNode based wrappers of the low level renderables
    + SceneNode based wrappers of the low level audibles (planned)


  - Mesh Processing
     + construct and edit meshes live in-engine, finalize and cache for rendering
     + python bindings allow interoperability with numpy style 3D mesh frameworks


  - Includes python bindings

  - Notable dependencies (License):
    + Ork.Core (Boost, permissive)
    + OpenGL (Permissive)
